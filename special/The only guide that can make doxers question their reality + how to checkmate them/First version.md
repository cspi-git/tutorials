I will update this guide regularly If I want to add more stuff & fix some mistakes, so If you want to keep updated just regularly view this thread If you want.

--- Start ----
This is for educational purposes only and this guide only teaches you how to scare doxers, prevent getting doxed & punish them not kill them.

# Introduction
Warnings:
- Please make sure your PC(Device) is not compromised & free from malware or else all will be useless.
- If you are an idiot(Maybe?) & already got doxed with the information verified your screwed goodluck. Just kidding THEN you SHOULD read this guide until the end.

Will the FBI be included in this guide? Might be but they won't just act dumbly they will only act If you are getting on their nerves or crossing their line.

Trusted no logging VPN & Tor is needed here.

Different types of doxers:
- The try hard - The one that has the determination to find & leak your info but unable to because not too smart.
- The expert - The scary doxers.
- The noob - Beginners in doxing.
- The wannabe expert/An idiot - Easy to manipulate & likes to boast.

Doxers are easy to manipulate because all they do is just scrape & research the internet for your personal info in different sources. 

Basicly imagine that a killer is hunting you in the forest but got far away then you slip and got covered by mud and found a city nearby but somehow got away, while the killer was chasing you he will pass by the mud that you slip off saw that you slip due to the impact of your fall and 95% the killer first instinct will be "Find him using the mud"(Your footstep) because every footstep you make will leave a mark of the mud on the floor. So how to manipulate the killer? When you know your really far from the killer you can just simply mislead him by removing your shoes and make fake footstep using the shoes to mislead the killer. Of course the situation with doxer is different but they have a lot of differences.

And since this guide has been public(Free) doxers(Who had read this guide) will probably not be easy to trick but there is always a way to outsmart(Goodluck lol) their smart brain. Too much talking here let's get started.

# Taking control of your accounts
## Secure your accounts
First off, secure your accounts so they do not merge and meet each other imagine 2 boxes where on the first box is where you put your personal accounts and the second box is where you place the accounts you used for hacking after that separate the two box and make sure they do not get near each other so what does that mean?

1. List all the accounts that you used personally then list all the accounts that you used for hacking.
2. Put a category in each accounts just like what I said the boxes after you know your personal & non personal accounts(Hacking or etc).
3. Get the information of each accounts Including recovery emails, phone numbers & scrape them for information and find connections to your other accounts.

Now that you have all the information of the accounts become a detective and see the connections between the personal & non personal/boxes.
Let's say you spotted that your Facebook recovery email(Personal box) is also used in your **Hacking Forum**(Hacking box) account where you do stuff illegally with a VPN I'm sure you probably already realized that even If you used a VPN the NSA can just get the account recovery email and backtrack you easily since you used it for your personal stuff. So delete your **Hacking Forum** account If the website logs everything if not then just change your recovery email and make a new one using temporary email or make a new protonmail account with VPN/Tor.
And of course always use a VPN/Tor every time you go to your hacking box AND ALWAYS double check because a single mistake can be your doom.

What about my personal accounts?
Go to your gmail then just delete the hacking forum verification & stuff or change your personal account recovery code(Not recommended) because-
It can make things 10x harder and probably useless because Facebook logs everything/any other site and It will make you reset everything. As long as there are no connection between your hacking accounts & personal then your 100% safe.

## Removes traces
Search your real name & information and the names of your accounts online and If you found your real name/a personal info in search people website just contact the support to delete your personal information in the website and for your non personal account names If your personal name has been leaked due to your past mistake don't panic because everything in the internet can be faked instead take note because It's better to know what is going on than not to prevent it, separate your non personal account more because they will also need to verify If the personal info on the website is real(If you have not reveal your real name/showed your face).

Also use:
https://intelx.io/
https://haveibeenpwned.com/

And any other leak search engines stuff & change your passwords If leaked. But let's say you used your personal email for hacking(Biggest mistake ever) and It got leaked somehow in the intelx.io with your personal info(Because you used them), your doomed just kidding you still have a few chance to win hopefully "Outsmart your doxers like a game of chess" will give you an idea how(Too lazy to fully list all the things to do)( Hey don't PM ME I won't answer :) ).

## No Connections
1. Make sure the names of the non personal accounts are random or/and has limited connection to each other.
2. Make sure the boxes connections are SPLIT/SEPARATED far away.

## Delete Garbages
Dig as much as accounts from your past and the present then delete every unused accounts(Either message the website support or something or find the "Delete my account" button something) because It can risk you.

## Summary
Just imagine the connections of each of the things that you do in the internet & cut them off, and for fun try to find yourself & act as the FBI/Doxer & simulate their stuff and see If you can find yourself(Then just remove those traces/your findings).

## Q&A
What If I don't have a VPN? Then use Tor If you can't then try to earn money & buy somehow.

What about the names?
MAKE SURE to not use your personal name in your non personal accounts and use names that have no similarity or use deception.

No similarity names:
1. QB0x529
2. InstiGamingBoy
3. UltraF_4
4. Neptnee

Deception names: Just use fake names from https://fake-it.ws/ & make sure they look like real names.

What If they verified?
When doxing someone they leak your info so on your note get the names that they got then search your accounts with those names then delete those accounts but that will cause suspicion so don't instead just change your name(Or not) or post that they got the wrong person information and I don't live there and just post normally in your personal account like nothing is wrong. But If they got your IP in a hacking forum somehow then they are probably one of the admin and your VPN probably leaked your personal IP with that they have 98% to verify their dox. But If not then you can still win just be calm & play with their mind and make them question about the information that they found.

To trick doxers as well as the doxers who found your real info you should move on "Outsmart your doxers like a game of chess".

# Outsmart your doxers like a game of chess
Only move to this part after you have successfully executed/done the "Taking control of your accounts".

What we exploit here:
- Curiosity
- Determination

Basicly their mind.

## Misinformation
*Coughs* all 98% of doxers first search your name. Right RIGHT? Yes. Let the game begin.

First visit every popular pastes like(Mostly Doxbin):
- https://doxbin.com/
- https://pastebin.com/

Then post something like for example(Use VPN/Tor):
```
Title: AquaK3ller Doxxed/AquaK3ller Personal Infos by @Anonymous
Body:
Here you can just put random info.
```
In real action example:
```
Title: Z0lf Doxxed!
Body:
Full Name: Any
Real Name: Any
Fathers Name: Any
Mothers Name: Any
Country: Any
City: Any
Street: Any
Phone Number: Any
Email: Any
```

But don't execute this one first and you must read this part fully first. This part will make the doxers question the information they found so don't just post random info in the pastes(Also make a video in Youtube if possible) also sometimes post with the correct information(The information that you have public only like you said you live in US & etc) then post like 8+ pastes in different random sources this will activate the "Don't trust anything" in the doxers brain which will drastically slow them down.

And the doxers who said they found your real information don't ignore them instead extract the information they found so you can make advance moves ahead and If you found out the infos are real/not just say "Nope this aren't my personal information" no matter what & don't panic. Of course they will be constant but say to them "Okay sure let's say those are my personal info leak them It's fine because they aren't mine and who tf is {The full name they got} :skull:".

## The back tracking
To complicate things for the doxer who found your real info(If he is messaging)(Some message their target to verify their findings and idiots don't) but still verifying(Even if not):

Method 1:
If you have any messaging platform account make an alt on the platform then message yourself with "LOL Kid I doxed your info https://doxbin.com/fafafafa" and with your main account with a reply of "Bro wtf"(Make it look real) of course the link contains a real doxbin link BUT with fake info(With some correct info like I said above) then screenshot & blur the link but not too much(Still readable but blurry too) then show it to the other doxer(Then after 2 minutes/few minutes say OOPS or not) then delete it of course because of CURIOSITY that doxer already visited the link and see the info(This will hella make him question his finding since he hasn't verified it yet/even If he did because you have not revealed your real name & stuff). Then ask him for his email and say "I will pay you 40$ can you please not leak the link on the ss"? Of course who would not accept a 40$ offer just to keep a link secret? Then he will say how will you pay me with just an email only? say "Google Pay" If he wants crypto just decline it and force him to give his Paypal(Better) email basicly just try to get his email. After you got his email message him with "Idiot you got the wrong info lol" then just block him(This he will still question the info he found and probably will do more research) and take note of the email(Probably make notepad or something) for later use.

Keep in mind for the doxers who made a mistake don't interrupt them just like what Napoleon said "Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.". I'm sure upon reading the "Next to complicate things for the doxer who found your real info" part It will give you lots of ideas & you can use those ideas to manipulate your doxers & etc. AND AND Of course take note of everything including the doxer username on the probably he used to message you, the messages & etc and record a video of the 2 of you talking(If you talked to him in a call somehow?) this can be use as a powerful weapon & shield later. https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/when-your-information-has-been-revealed-online.html

Wait we are going to use the law? But I need proof of harass or that the doxer is damaging your reputation how can I do that? That's WHY we are taking notes.

Other methods: Hopefully **Method 1** will give you some ideas. :)

Note: Users who uses VPN or not this still works.

## I love my doxers
Yeah... The title sound's weird but did you know that you can befriend your doxer so they will help you instead of hating/destroying you? The key here is love & trust. You are basicly manipulating them well kinda? I have already tried this to a hacker who once tried to hack me and after I few days with some little task/favor to him & being friendly I was able to manipulate him without him knowing AND he literally really became my friend without me knowing and things starting to feel something wrong(Because I was backstabbing him). It's really simple you just have to befriend them.

"The only safe and sure way to destroy your enemy is to make him your friend." - Mark Twain

### Traps(Hive)
I don't recommend this part for non developers, but you can read it too If you want.

#### For Developers
##### IP Grabbing
Make an IP grabber then host in vercel/any hoster and It redirects you to the link you said then use bit.ly or url shorteners to hide the IP grabber link. Make sure the logged IPs are stored in a database for later uses.

Add it in the paste body like for example:
```
For more HQ doxes visit https://secretiplogger.com/
or
For more info about Z0lf https://secretiplogger.com/
```

##### Got you(An idea to give you more ideas)
Make a Discord account then make a verification bot so what the bot should do is you just have to visit the given link(Make sure it logs IP too) by the bot to verify(Like activation) your Discord account in a server but of course the link has an identifier to the user Discord account to verify them then save those info(Including IP) to the same database used for the "IP Grabbing" then make the bot popular or make a Discord server and make it popular with the bot.

The more servers are using the bot(More members too) the better.

#### For non developers
Make an IP grabber link(Use Grabify & similar stuff) of the blablblabla link then use bit.ly or url shorteners to hide the IP grabber link. Here you can view the IP of the users who viewed the fake doxes of you.

##### Got you(An idea to give you more ideas)
Make a Discord account then make a verification bot so what the bot should do is you just have to visit the given link(Make sure it logs IP too) to you to verify(Like activation) your account but of course the link has an identifier to the user Discord account to verify them then saves the info(Including IP) to the same database used for the "IP Grabbing" then make the bot popular or the Discord server.

The more servers are using the bot(More members too) the better.

What is "Got you" for though? Well If the doxer didn't use a VPN and visited your IP logger on the random pastes you posted you can find his Discord account for more attack via the bot.

I WANT MORE IDEAS & METHODS. Okay chill out I'm not gonna write an entire book with all the stuff that I know for free & not expensive so figure stuff on your own(DON'T PM ME).

## Doxing the doxer
If you are in this part already and all the contents above are executed perfectly that means you have already secured yourself. Now we attack after we have secured ourself for a future defend.

"Attack is the secret of defense; defense is the planning of an attack." - Sun Tzu

Uh yeah this will be a head itchy part. Smart doxers makes dummy accounts and dumb doxers uses their personal account which make things 10x easier to dox him.

Since dumb doxers are easy to dox let's start with smart doxers. So let's say the "Method 1"(Above) worked and you have extracted the doxer's email go to "https://intelx.io/" or any pwned check website then search for his email(To get more info & further back track).

Let's say you got some info:
You must do deep research more check the recovery emails that he used in the leaked databases and search them again use multiple OSINT tools in Github until you will be able to know who is the person behind the email.

If you did not get any info in the email:
Do every social engineering on them.

Examples:
- Befriend them then slowly extract information.
- Trick them or phish them via their email.
- Etc

What if the "Method 1" did not worked?
Still do a social engineering until you will be able to get valuable information(e.g Phone number, email, full name & etc)(Just a country is not valuable) and do every possible OSINT you know.

Even If you have to download his profile picture to find geolocation in the image EXIF data. Or If you are a developer who knows how to make a malware you can hire him as a tester like make a nitro generator(Or a program) compile to exe(Little did he know the program has a stealer secretly coded in it) and convince him to test it If it works on VM or personal PC & etc for example "Hey can you test this? I add a VM protection check If it works in VM or non VM. If it works we will share profit :D" be friendly too but yes you have to risk of sending him money first of course only send a money less than 8$ like 5-6$.

## Finding fake friends(Imposter)
Since they are your friends I'm sure you know some infos about them and they know some infos about you. Make another account in the messaging platform that you both used to message. Ask him like "Hey do you know Z0lf? Do you know where he live?" stuff like that and If he said it don't just immediately jump to conclusion that his a bad friend because there are many ways to social engineer someone so It's just better to not tell your personal infos to your friends online(Unless real life) or just find ways to secure your friends too or just your info in your friends hands.

# A psycho
Sometimes to defeat an evil we must become a greater evil and make them fear because fear controls them. Kids who doxes you will probably panic in this part. Only move on this part after you have successfully doxed your doxer. OF COURSE while we are in this part you MUST not reveal your IDENTITY and boast like you go to your main account then message the doxer with "I got your personal information lol" that's literally really dumb and your biggest mistake.

Psttt. If the doxer is a girl just take her easy not hard girl's hearts are weak with just a simple threat 99.5% she will stop annoying you and cry and maybe you might be able to change her by befriending her(Of course don't just jump on her but instead like approach her like you both have just met or know each other). Oh yeah after you heard the word "girl" some who read who has this first thought in their mind "Hold up I have the power. I can just black mail her or spy on her." Boi you idiot good luck getting backtrack(What how? Read what I had quote and you will know) & abusing power is bad.

## Threating the doxer
- Send them a threat message that sounds scary via protonmail or anonymous mails(Use VPN/Tor).

https://maillater.com/
https://mailspre.com/
https://anonymousemail.me/

- Nuke their email with threat message.
- Nuke their phone number with threat message.
- Call their parents for what they have done anonymously using burner phone.

Oh yeah when sending threat message DO NOT reveal your name or IDENTITY. Just say like "Stop doxing or I'll come to your house and kill you" no names or connections the only lead is the email source.

## No matter what move you make I already checkmate you
Oh is that doxer annoying you again? Just do every possible way to scare him with all the information that you got. He doesn't care? Cross the line. Most doxers will stop doxing after the "Threating the doxer" and some doxer doesn't and/or will decline the information that you got(Even though you have already verified) or he just doesn't care, some will say "What are you gonna do"? Bro that is literally the dumbest thing to say. If you messed up with the wrong person who has enough money or connections he can literally pay a kidnapper to kidnap you and with enough brain power If he can do it anonymously your basicly doomed.

You can't fight back an invisible person(He can touch you, you can't touch him.). You will just basicly be a sitting duck getting beaten unless he made a mistake and you can get an idea to get leads or become Light in the Death Note.

So what to do here If you were the doxer? You can try to file a complain(Court)(Check mate. This can also screw you for doxing and other illegal stuff that you probably did) or just glue your mouth, stop doxing & apologize to every person that you have doxed.

# End of the game
