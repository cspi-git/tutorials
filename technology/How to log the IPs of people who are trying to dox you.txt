2. Make database called "self" and a collection called "ips" in the database
3. Install NodeJS v14
4. Search & Download this file **ID: 00001** in #resources then unzip it.
5. Open your CMD in the folder then type "npm i vercel -g"
6. Register to https://vercel.com/
7. In the folder modules > mongodb.js find "MONGODB_DBHERE" then change it with your MongoDB url.
8. Type "vercel --prod" then login and go with the flow(Name it something like **Private Dox Hub**).
9. You will get a URL.
10. Setup is done.

Method 1 to checkmate a doxer:
1. Go to https://doxbin.com/
2. Make a paste with fake information in https://en.namefake.com/ but only post the half.
3. Make a HTML file in the public users with full info.
4. On the last body of the doxbin paste, paste your IP logger their linked to the user information.
5. Post the paste.

Hope this gives you some ideas. "Misinformation is what makes any person doubt with the information he already has."
