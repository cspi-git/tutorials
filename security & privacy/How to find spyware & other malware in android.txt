**Firewall**
First we use a firewall. I recommend: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.greyshirts.firewall

1. Install & run it.
2. Make sure to enable start in boot then restart your device.
3. See all the apps that are trying to connect, If they don't look familiar to you then they might be a malware.
4. Disable start in boot so your device can network faster. Only do this/check your device network once a week.

**Apps running in the background**
1. Download my favorite app. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.killrunningapps.taskkiller&gl=US
2. Run it & you will see all apps that are running. You can also enable see system apps.
3. If some apps don't look familiar to you then they might be a malware.
4. I recommend that every time you turn off your phone. Run **App Task Killer** and kill all your apps before shutting down your device.

If you found a malware just locate their path and delete them.
