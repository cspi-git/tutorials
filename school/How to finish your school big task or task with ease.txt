Name: How to finish your school big task/task with ease?
Tags: psychology, finishing, tasks

1. Don't be shy just think positive. If you are shy that means you have a low self-belief and can easily be manipulate(Not a threat, just saying to motivate).
2. Make as much as friends in your school mostly in your classroom. More friends = more information(Connections)
3. Just ask them about the task for example. "Good morning :D, how do I make the big task?" then follow up with "Can you please give an example?", controlling the situation should be a priority and why did you add a smile? to give a positive energy.
4. Also joke, joking can sometimes make people laugh or make them do something without thinking the conscience(Bad spelling), If they are so hype about something sometimes they can't think right.
5. Just rephrase their example/task then your done but of course thank them too and joke about like "thank you for giving your task and the answer. Sharing is caring :)".
